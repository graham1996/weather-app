# weather-app

##Description
This app uses the openweathermap.org API to fetch the current and 5 day forecast for a specified city. 
Simply input a city into the search box and you will recieve a forecast back.
This app is still under construction, and therefore is not very pretty, but is fully functional as is.
Please check back soon to see any changes!
